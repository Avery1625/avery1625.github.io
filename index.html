The past four months with you have been unbelievable, and I'm so grateful to be able to enter this new year with you. I love you so so so much. I'm constantly in awe of your consideration and care for me, your family, and your friends even while you've been struggling. This relationship has taught me so much and I believe it's improved my character along with my life. You always push me to be better. </p1> 
        <br><p2 class="typey">I would eat 12 grapes at midnight but I think you're all the luck I need. Thank you so much for an amazing 2024 and I can't wait for the new year with you.</p2>
